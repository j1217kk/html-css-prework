                <h1 id="journey">Journey to Coding Temple</h1>
                <p>It has been a long journey to get to <em>Coding Temple</em>. I graduated several years ago with a  Bachelor's degree in Information Systems. To be completely honest, I chose that major for no real reason other than knowing it was a relevant/safe degree.
                At the time, I didn't have my priorities as in line as I do now. I landed my first role out of college as an IT Analyst, where I debugged server issues for <em> The <abbr title="The United States">U.S.</abbr> Census Bureau </em> in a windowless, non-team oriented environment. The poor experience
                really caused me to seek a different career path. I remember that at the time I really didn't have much resolve or passion to begin with for the industry even though it was my major. I ended up becoming an Account Executive over at 
                <em>Yelp</em> in Washington, D.C. selling advertisement slots/perks to businesses. I performed at a high level during my first stint as a salesman and eventually landed a lead development representative role with
                <abbr title="Amazon Web Services"><em>AWS</em></abbr>, where I was involved with the sale of cloud tech. At <em>Amazon</em>, I learned more than I ever have during my days at university. <em>Amazon</em> really changed my professional way of thinking, and they brought the best out of me. I became
                an avid and active learner; I also began to think of the larger picture in terms of my career. I made a transition over to Technical Recruiting, because I wanted to gain insight into the recruitment process at <em>Amazon</em>. It was a very enjoyable tenure,
                and I met some of the most impactful people during my year as a Tech Recruiter with <em>Amazon Global Advertising</em>. As a Tech Recruiter, the two main roles I recruited for were <b>Software Development Engineers</b> (back-end focused) as well as 
                <b>Front-End Engineers</b>. After learning and gaining so much insight about the software engineering role/ what it takes to be one at the highest level, as well as talking to engineers every day on the phone... I became inspired. This has led me to today. I wanted
                to be able to tie all my experience together, and embark on a journey into a new field that I have built both ambition and passion for in software engineering. <em>Coding Temple</em> is the catalyst that will push me towards achieving my goals!
